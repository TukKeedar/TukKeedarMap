# TukKeedarMap (Red Blob)

Will need a "tampermonkey". I have tested in Firefox and Opera, and have no reason to think it doesnt work in Chrome.

Just copy the contents of the "maindeal.js" into a new script in tampermonkey.
If you want to request a template added, then bother the people who told you about this in the discord...
